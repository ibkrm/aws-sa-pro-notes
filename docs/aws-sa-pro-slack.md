### questions topic
- AWS MSK (kafka), DataSync, many Redshift and EMR questions and RAM.

- EC2, networking, ECB "availability" questions and migration questions.
- There were lots and lots and LOTS of questions on:
    - AWS Organisations
    - Migrations
    - RAM
    - TGW
    - ECS
- GWLB, Client VPN, S3, GA, DDB, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, Transfer Family, RDS Proxy 
- Many had an Organizations angle, I had MSK too
- few on prem/cloud connectivity and DR, DX, VPN, and Transit GW
- DDB for global availability and Global tables in the middle of the answers, but the words 'data corruption..' were in the Q
- another very similar answer included backup which would allow recovery from corruptions.
- AWS Organizations (easily 5-10), networking (VPN, Direct Connect, DC & Transit Gateway, VPC Peering), Aurora vs RDS and DynamoDB, S3 access logs, CF Stack Sets, Storage Gateway, Resource Sharing, Transfer Family
- Lots of organisation / RAM questions/ cross region services and a question on GWLB.
