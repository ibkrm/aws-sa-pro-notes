### questions topic
- AWS MSK (kafka), DataSync, many Redshift and EMR questions and RAM. 
- policy questions where you had to decifer policy code
- EC2, networking, ECB "availability" questions and migration questions.
- There were lots and lots and LOTS of questions on:
    - AWS Organisations
    - Migrations
    - RAM
    - TGW
    - ECS
- GWLB, Client VPN, S3, GA, DDB, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, Transfer Family, RDS Proxy 
- Many had an Organizations angle, I had MSK too
- few on prem/cloud connectivity and DR, DX, VPN, and Transit GW
- DDB for global availability and Global tables in the middle of the answers, but the words 'data corruption..' were in the Q
- another very similar answer included backup which would allow recovery from corruptions.
- AWS Organizations (easily 5-10), networking (VPN, Direct Connect, DC & Transit Gateway, VPC Peering), Aurora vs RDS and DynamoDB, S3 access logs, CF Stack Sets, Storage Gateway, Resource Sharing, Transfer Family
- Lots of organisation / RAM questions/ cross region services and a question on GWLB.
### whitepapers
AWS Organizations User Guide, Building a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC AWS Network Infrastructure Whitepaper, and Serverless Architectures with AWS Lambda Whitepaper.

- , lots and lots of questions about DX so make sure you have that down
- 3 questions about RDS proxy as well, so worth having a look at that.
-  AWS Wavelength was a distractor used in two questions, and ground station was used to distract from a simple data migration job from a site to S3
- one question about Fully Managed Apache Kafka (MSK) -- HA or fault tolerant ???
- I recall one question on AWS Control Tower
- one question where 2 options were to send the notification by SNS vs 2 options by SES
- question where 2 options were with “s3 sync” and 2 options with Datasync agent.
