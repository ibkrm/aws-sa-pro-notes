### VPC Flow Logs
- Capture **packet Metadata** .. **NOT  packet contents**
- Different monitoring points to apply... 
    - **VPC** - all interfaces in the VPC
    - **Subnet** - all interfaces in that subnet
    - **Interface directly**
- VPC Flow Logs are **NOT realtime**
- Destination can be **S3** or **Cloudwatch Logs**

#### Flow logs do not capture all IP traffic. The following types of traffic are not logged:

- Traffic generated by instances when they contact the Amazon DNS server. If you use your own DNS server, then all traffic to that DNS server is logged.

- Traffic generated by a Windows instance for Amazon Windows license activation.

- Traffic to and from 169.254.169.254 for instance metadata.

- Traffic to and from 169.254.169.123 for the Amazon Time Sync Service.

- DHCP traffic.

- Mirrored traffic.

- Traffic to the reserved IP address for the default VPC router.

- Traffic between an endpoint network interface and a Network Load Balancer network interface.
